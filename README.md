# Simple chatty bot

## About the project

The project is designed by [JetBrains Academy](https://www.jetbrains.com/academy/) and realised as a part of [Java Developer track](https://hyperskill.org/onboarding) using [EduTools](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10081-edutools) plugin for [IDEA InteliJ IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).

Super simple basic program that can ask some questions to user and print to the console output based on the user input.
Reading it's code helps to understand basic syntax of Java and teaches how to use variables, conditions, loops and functions.

[Detailed description](https://hyperskill.org/projects/31) of the project is available on JetBrains Academy website.

### Realisation of the project was divided into 4 stages:
- Stage #1. Printing data to the console.
- Stage #2. Adding user input and doing simple math operations.
- Stage #3. Applying simple loop.
- Stage #4. Adding conditions and methods.

### Main topics covered by this project
